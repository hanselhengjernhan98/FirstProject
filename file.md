This is a snake game, where the end goal is to survive for as long as possible.

You may not touch the snake's body with the snake head, and may not touch the outer grids. Upon touching any of the aforementioend things, you will lose and will have to try again.

This game has a small twist, where the keys have been swapped. This will mean that the left key will bring your snake to the right, and the right key will bring your snake to the left. Likewise, the top key will bring your snake down, and the bottom key will bring your snake up.

Have fun!
