This is a snake game, where the end goal is to survive for as long as possible.

It was a game that was played when I was younger on a nokia phone, and I have been hooked for quite sometime, even after I stopped using that nokia phone!

For some of us who might not know how to play it, here's a brief description of how to do so:

You may not touch the snake's body with the snake head, and may not touch the outer grids. Upon touching any of the aforementioend things, you will lose and will have to try again. As can be seen in the screenshot, the game will stop when you 'die' from either of these scenarios with a pop up message.

This game has a small twist, where the keys have been swapped. This will mean that the left key will bring your snake to the right, and the right key will bring your snake to the left. Likewise, the top key will bring your snake down, and the bottom key will bring your snake up.

Javascript was used to code the logic of the game, with CSS grids to code get the game up onto the board. HTML was used too but there wasn't much, outside of putting the gameboard onto the body of the HTML, and linking it to the javascript and CSS files.

For future enhancements to the game, I intend to include bombs that will randomly appear on the grid. Upon touching any of the bombs, the snake will die and it will cause a loss. Another strech goal will be to include music, and an 'eating sound' when it eats the food.
